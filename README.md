## Project plan

The project plan should contain:

- The scope of the project
- Relevant literature currently covering the topic
- The steps the group plans to take in order to achieve the planned goals 

Project plans **may not be longer than 2 pages**.


## Final draft

- The final draft does not need to follow a pre-specified format, but they will at least include an introduction and a main body with the group's findings. 

- Any generated plots/tables that appear in the draft must be accompanied by the scripts, spreadsheets or programs that generated them. Ideally, those would be published in github. 
    + Datasets, especially large ones, should not be included in this part
    + Instead, provide a description of how the dataset was put together, and how to use it in order to run your program/script/spreadsheet
